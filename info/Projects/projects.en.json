		"projectDescription" : "In December 2016 me and two colleagues attended to the 3ITC contest organised by ITIMF department of the University “Petrol-Gaze” from Ploiești. We’ve obtained the first place with the application “iziApp”. The main purpose of this application is to ease the communication and interaction between a teacher and his/her students. The application allows a teacher to create accounts for each student, to create and manage multiple classrooms, post certain information about upcoming events in every classroom he/she created or even send and download resources like electronic books, tutorial videos, exercise files, etc. Another feature of this application is the possibility of creating and sending quizzes. For example, at the end of a lesson a teacher can create a set of questions to test his/her students’ knowledge. The quiz appear on everyone’s device and they answer those questions while the teacher gets real-time feedback. For developing this application I’ve used Node.js along with express framework for implementing MVC pattern and sockets for real-time interaction. For templating the application uses EJS Templating language and the front-end of the application uses the bootstrap framework. The application is available at this address: https://iziapp.herokuapp.com",

You have to choose the products you’re looking for in a supermarket and the app finds an optimal way for you to get all the items you asked, marking them on a store map. For example, when you go shopping you don’t know all the items’ location in that store you’re in, so by checking with the application you can easily see where the product you’re looking for is located, or you can create a shopping list from home and follow the map indications when you are in the store. For this application I’ve used Java and XML as the programming languages, the Android Studio IDE and Oracle Database for the database.",
